 The location parameter is the URL_FOR where response should be redirected

## Contents :
The contents in the home page were motivatedly written by me from the inspiration of being a chef for about 5years now.
The view of the collected recipes in home page is made possible from 'materialize' and also inspired from the lessons in the tutorial.
<br>Also the 'Add recipe' page which is the second page of the website is a collection of html form from materialize and also inspired from the lessons.
<br> The third page which is 'My Kitchen' is self inspired and pictures collected from google search to showcase some of the important 
kitchen tools required to facilitate efficient cooking.
<br> All the photos in this website which showcases either dishes or kitchen tools were derived from a google search.
